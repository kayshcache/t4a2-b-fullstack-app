# T3A2-B Full Stack Application (Part B)
## Industry Simulated Project
The students will build the Full Stack web application that they designed in Full Stack Application (Part A). They will present their completed application.	Industry Simulated Project	CMP1043: 1 ; PRG1006: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7	14% of CMP1043, 62% of PRG1006	
## Due Week 10
## Introduction
As an aspiring developer and cyber security professional, it is important to be able to communicate and demonstrate your abilities to prospective employers.

This task requires you to demonstrate that you can build a complete application from design through to deployment for a specified use case.

Real World App - Part B requires you to deliver the coding component of of this project, with accompanying documentation.
## Coding Requirements
1. R1	**Write well designed code that:**
 	Separates the program into modules that each deal with one particular focus, or concern
 	Demonstrates DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) coding principles
 	Uses appropriate libraries
 	Demonstrates good code flow control for user stories
 	Applies Object Oriented (OO) principles/patterns
 	Uses appropriate data structures
2. R2	Employ and utilise proper source control methodology (git)
3. R3	Use a recognised project management methodology
4. R4	Use a recognised task delegation methodology
5. R5	Produce a working application that meets user needs
6. R6	Deploy the application to a cloud hosting service
7. R7	Produce an application with an intuitive user interface
8. R8	**Provides evidence of user testing**:
 	In the development environment
 	In the production environment
9. R9	Utilises a formal testing framework
10. Where is requirement 10?

## Documentation Requirements
Single README + /docs for attachments
11. R11	A link (URL) to your deployed website
12. R12	A link to your GitHub repository (repo)
Ensure the repo is accessible by your educators!
13. R13	The contents of your README.md as submitted for Real World App - Part A
## Presenation Requirements
Less than 10 minutes
## Requirements Checklist:
- CMP1043-1.2 Demonstrate DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles in all code: Excellent use of DRY principles, every piece of knowledge has a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation
